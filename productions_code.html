      	<h2>Computer language topics</h2>
		<p>
          This page covers a range of programming and markup languages that I have happened to cover as part of various projects, including education and personal interest projects (or a combination of both, for documentation purposes!)
        </p>
      		<ul>
              <li>There is a set of notes, <em>From Real Analysis to Metric Spaces</em>, which I have started working on. The source code and corresponding output can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/dnmftkkwvgbv">on Overleaf</a>, from where the notes can be downloaded or the source code used to modify the notes to your use case. <br>(These notes are under development, and so there may be errors that have not been spotted. If any are found, I am more than happy <a href="about_contact.html">to be contacted</a>.)</li>
              <li>There is also a set of notes that I had created for a university level maths module, <em>Algebraic Number Theory</em>. As per above, the source code and output .pdf <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/sffvzntzxdng">can be found on Overleaf</a>. These were made in the first half of 2019 (mostly within a week for students I was tutoring), and since then, and have seen little revisions since then (the usual "[mathematical] errors may exist, please let me know" disclaimer still applies!)</li>
              <li>For this site, a basic template of the HTML and CSS can be found <a href="template_with_css.html">here</a>. The CSS is embedded into the template in a style tag, though in most pages on this site, the CSS is in a separate file. The HTML file can be downloaded and reused if there is a wish to, though (and <em>because</em>) the design is rather basic. The CSS is rather messy, being based on multiple revisions to get the design I wanted.</li>
              <li>A set of Jupyter notebooks for Python can be found <a href="#">here (to be added)</a>. A range of different areas are covered, including web scraping with the requests and BeautifulSoup modules, creating JSON and .csv files with the respective modules, and math based tasks (including using Numpy).</li>
              <li>In due time, I hope to contain more content, including C++ and more LaTeX files.</li>
