    	<h2>University level maths work</h2>
		<p>
        	This is a collection of some of the university level math slides, scans and notes that I have made. These are duplicated on the <a href="productions_code">coding page</a>, as the source code is contained as well:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a set of notes, <em>From Real Analysis to Metric Spaces</em>, which I have started working on. The source code and corresponding output can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/dnmftkkwvgbv">on Overleaf</a>, from where the notes can be downloaded or the source code used to modify the notes to your use case. <br>(These notes are under development, and so there may be errors that have not been spotted. If any are found, I am more than happy <a href="about_contact.html">to be contacted</a>.)</li>
                <li>There is also a set of notes that I had created for a university level maths module, <em>Algebraic Number Theory</em>. As per above, the source code and output .pdf <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/sffvzntzxdng">can be found on Overleaf</a>. These were made in the first half of 2019 (mostly within a week for students I was tutoring), and since then, and have seen little revisions since then (the usual "[mathematical] errors may exist, please let me know" disclaimer still applies!)</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>There is also a set of virtual whiteboard slides I have made:</p>
      		<ul>
              <li>A set of slides made based on the book <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em> by Walter Rudin (a very well written book, if I must say). There are three sets of slides which cover chapters 2, 3, and 4, with three sets of slides. The <a href="#">first</a>, <a href="#">second</a> and <a href="#">third</a> installations can be found in the respective links.</li>
              <li>A collection of a range of topics, from groups, partial differenial equations, linear algebra and more. These can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</li>
      		</ul>
        <p>
      		(Many of these links have not been filled out, and there is more to come, this page is still under construction.)
