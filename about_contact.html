      <h3>About me and contact page</h3>
		<p>
        	Welcome to my website. I have created it mainly as a showcase for the projects and material I have made throughout the years, mostly math and development/programming-based.
        </p>
			<ul>
              <li>This page will be filled out properly eventually, I hope at least.</li>
              <li>Any messages or requests in the meantime can be made to <a href="mailto:hello_there@chartb.me">hello_there@chartb.me</a>, where I will do my best to help.</li>
			</ul>
      		Eventually this site will be filled out, hopefully one day, after all I am paying to have it hosted!
        <br>
